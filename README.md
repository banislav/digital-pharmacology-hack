Sintelli hackathon
=======================
# About hackathon

# Task
Based on open (available in the literature and the Internet) data collect your own original dataset and build a model based on it machine learning to predict toxicity rates chemical compounds.

To build a model, you need to collect a dataset from open sources.  For each predicted indicator from each team only one model can be provided.  Number of predicted indicators - no more than 100 per team.

## Requirements

1. Presentation with a description of your solution (pptx/pdf, no more than 10 MB);
2. One Jupyter laptop with the solution code in the programming language
Python 3.8, which:
    a) at the input for each model receives a text .csv file with a list of molecules in SMILES format, and outputs a .csv file with the same list of SMILES and corresponding to each SMILES with the value of the predicted indicator (only two columns);
    b) contains a complete pipeline of model training, including the processes of parameter selection, hyperparameters, model architecture.
It is necessary to ensure the execution of a Jupyter laptop for any test SMILES. It is guaranteed that the test SMILES will be presented in canonical form from the RD Kit library. In each section of the laptop, it is necessary to write comments describing the actions performed.
3. Training datasets used to build the model for each predicted parameter in the format .csv with multiple columns: list SMILES, the experimental value of the predicted indicator corresponding to SMILES (each source has its own column). For datasets, data sources must be explicitly specified (in the presentation and in the Jupyter laptop);
4. Additional files that you need to use when applying the machine learning model or that experts may need when evaluating your solution. For example, for after starting your laptop, you can provide an installation of the libraries that you use to take into account their compatibility (ReadMe file, requirements.txt etc.). If the Expert cannot run Your Jupyter is a laptop, then at the discretion of the expert, 0 points can be awarded for the work. In the absence of one of the required files in paragraphs 1-4 or inconsistency of the solution and the task, the experts reserve the right not to evaluate the work. We have also prepared a list of databases and literature that may be useful for solving this problem.
